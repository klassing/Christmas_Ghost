# klassyLights

## Description
This is a class that is intended to be run on the 'Christmas Ghost' platform, for spreading the holiday cheer with a bit of lighting.

## Light Patterns

### Rainbow
The array will be filled with a constant/fluid rainbow effect.  This can be called in a main loop as follows:

    rainbow_pattern();

There are no input parameters required, and this will fill up the entire string defined by #define constants.

The pattern will look like this when output to the light string:

![rainbow_pattern](supporting_images/gif/rainbow_pattern.gif)
